/**
 * Boost V2 dual driver participation — derived from the EXISTING organization
 * membership relationship, never a stored driver_type flag. Behavior changes
 * automatically when a driver joins or leaves a fleet, with no extra sync:
 *
 *   employed     → active fleet membership: story CTA is "Recommend to Fleet
 *                  Owner" (reward-eligible; never bids directly).
 *   independent  → no active membership: story CTA is "Bid Now" via the
 *                  existing bid lifecycle. No recommendation reward — they're
 *                  already the bidder.
 *   invited      → membership pending: "Join your fleet to participate"
 *                  (growth loop; transitions to employed automatically).
